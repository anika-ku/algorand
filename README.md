onchain will
A simple, secure on-chain will for the Algorand blockchain. This dApp allows you to designate a beneficiary who can claim your assets after a set period of inactivity, ensuring your digital legacy is protected and your final wishes are carried out on-chain.

âœ¨ Features
Trustless Execution: Your will is executed automatically by a smart contract, removing the need for intermediaries.

Liveness Check: The will-maker can periodically "check in" with the contract to reset the timer, preventing premature execution.

Beginner-Friendly: A clear, simple smart contract built to demonstrate core Algorand concepts like global state and access control.

Secure & Transparent: All actions are public and verifiable on the Algorand blockchain.
